# Welcome to NVIDIA OSMO

OSMO is an open framework for end-to-end robotics development scaled across heterogenous compute​ nodes.

OSMO enables robotics developers to scale the AI development seamlessly from PC or workstations to large sized compute clusters in the cloud

## What's new​

* Available Now as Open-Source on Github​
* Run OSMO locally before scaling to the cloud​
​
## Key benefits​

* Unify simultaneous execution across diverse compute nodes specialized for AI model training, simulation or physical AI runtime.​
* Simple zero-code YAML based workflow configuration scalable with custom build systems or AI agents​
* Connect any Kubernetes compute backend ​
* Integrate with to your existing services with open standards - identity provider, container registries and storage ​
* Deploy in air-gapped environments


## Try OSMO

Deploy OSMO on your laptop or any workstation with a [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md).

## Deploy on Cloud

Follow these steps for cloud deployment

* Create required resources in the cloud for hosting OSMO using Terraform

  * [AWS](deployments/terraform/aws/example/README.md)
  * [Azure](deployments/terraform/azure/example/README.md)

* Deploy and configure OSMO using our [Deployment Guide](https://nvidia.github.io/OSMO/deployment_guide)

## Documentation

If you are an AI / ML /robotics developer, follow our [User Guide](https://nvidia.github.io/OSMO/user_guide) to run OSMO workflows
