# Create Resource Pools

After registering a backend to OSMO, you must configure resource pools to organize and allocate compute resources. Users submit AI workflows to these pools, which define what resources are available and how they can be accessed. This configuration allows you to control resource allocation, set quotas, and manage access across different user groups.

For detailed information about pools, see [Resource Pools](../advanced_config/pool.md#pool).

## Configure Default Pool

OSMO automatically creates a default pool during initial service deployment. Link this pool to your registered backend by updating the pool configuration using the OSMO CLI:

```bash
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/pool_config.json
{
  "default": {
    "backend": "<backend-name>",
    "description": "<pool-description>"
  }
}
EOF

$ osmo config update POOL --file /tmp/pool_config.json
```

> **Note**
>
> If your backend is named `default`, you can skip this configuration step.

## Validate Pool Configs

Verify the pool configuration:

```bash
$ osmo pool list
Pool      Description    Status    GPU [#]
                                 Quota Used   Quota Limit   Total Usage   Total Capacity
=============================================================================================
default   Default pool   ONLINE    N/A          N/A           0             24
=============================================================================================
                                                              0             24
```
