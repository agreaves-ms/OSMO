# Next Steps

You have successfully completed:

✓ **Client Installed** - CLI installed and authenticated with OSMO

✓ **Profile Configured** - Notifications, default pool, and bucket set

✓ **Credentials Added** - Registry and data access configured

✓ **Ready to Run** - Your workflows can now access compute and storage

## What You Can Do Now

Your OSMO environment gives you access to:

* **Submit Workflows** - Define tasks in YAML, submit to OSMO, and let the platform handle scheduling and execution. ([Workflow Submission](../workflows/submission.md))
* **Interactive Development** - Use SSH, VSCode, or Jupyter notebooks to interactively develop and debug in running tasks. ([Interactive Workflows](../workflows/interactive/index.md))
* **Distributed Training** - Run training jobs and simulations across GPU clusters without managing infrastructure. ([TorchRun: Training Deep Learning Models](../how_to/training.md))
* **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** - Test robot policies on real hardware like Jetson while running simulation on GPU nodes. ([Hardware-in-the-Loop: Deploying Policy on Jetson](../how_to/hil.md))

## Run Your First Workflow

The [Hello World tutorial](../tutorials/hello_world/index.md#tutorials-hello-world) takes 5 minutes and covers:

* Creating a workflow YAML definition
* Submitting via CLI or Web UI
* Querying workflow status
* Retrieving logs and results
