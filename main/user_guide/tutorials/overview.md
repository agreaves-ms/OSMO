# Overview

Welcome to OSMO tutorials! This section will guide you through learning OSMO step by step,
from your first workflow to advanced patterns.

> **Note**
>
> **New to OSMO workflows?** These tutorials dive straight into hands-on examples.
> If you’d like to understand the concepts behind workflows, tasks, and groups first,
> we recommend reading the [Workflows Overview](../workflows/index.md#workflow-overview) section before starting.

> However, if you prefer learning by doing, you can jump right in and refer back to the
> [Workflows](../workflows/index.md#workflow-overview) section as needed!

## What You’ll Learn

These tutorials are designed to be completed in order, building your knowledge layer by layer:

---
> ##### 📖 **Fundamentals**
> 
> Master the basics of OSMO workflows
> 
> **1.** [Your First Workflow](hello_world/index.md#tutorials-hello-world)
> : Submit and run your first “Hello World” workflow
> 
> **2.** [Requesting Resources](requesting_resources.md#tutorials-requesting-resources)
> : Learn how to specify CPU, GPU, memory, and storage requirements
> 
> **3.** [Template and Tokens](template_and_tokens.md#tutorials-template-and-tokens)
> : Learn how to use templates and special tokens in a workflow spec
> 
> **4.** [Working with Data](data/index.md#tutorials-working-with-data)
> : Understand datasets, inputs, outputs, and data management

---
> ##### ⚙️ **Workflow Patterns**
> 
> Learn to orchestrate tasks in different execution patterns
> 
> **5.** [Serial Workflows](serial_workflows/index.md#tutorials-serial-workflows)
> : Create workflows where tasks run sequentially with dependencies
> 
> **6.** [Parallel Workflows](parallel_workflows/index.md#tutorials-parallel-workflows)
> : Build workflows that execute multiple tasks simultaneously
> 
> **7.** [Combination Workflows](combination_workflows/index.md#tutorials-combination-workflows)
> : Combine serial and parallel patterns by creating groups with dependencies

---
> ##### 🤖 **Advanced Topics**
> 
> Explore sophisticated patterns and hardware orchestration
> 
> **8.** [Hardware In The Loop (HIL)](hardware_in_the_loop/index.md#tutorials-gang-scheduling)
> : Run tasks across different hardware platforms (x86, ARM, GPU) simultaneously
> 
> **9.** [Advanced Patterns](advanced_patterns.md#tutorials-advanced-patterns)
> : Explore complex workflow patterns and optimization techniques
